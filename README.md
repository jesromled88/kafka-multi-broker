# Description
This is a fork from https://github.com/scneba/kafka-multi-broker

This project provides a mult-broker and multi-controller setup of kafka with Kafka docker containers. 
It also exposed the kafka ui through the  provectuslabs kafka-ui image. 

I change from Confluentinc/kafka to apache/kafka.


# Setup
- Run docker compose up -d in both folders /broker & /controllers.
